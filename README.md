Interactive Hospital Emergency Room dashboard built in Excel using Power Query, Pivot Tables and KPIs to analyze patient volume, wait time, satisfaction score, demographics 
and department referrals.


# Hospital Emergency Room Excel Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive Emergency Room (ER) dashboard created in Microsoft Excel.  
The purpose of the dashboard is to analyse hospital patient data and present important operational insights such as patient volume, waiting time and satisfaction level in a simple and understandable format.

The idea behind the project was to simulate a real reporting scenario where hospital management needs quick insights to monitor performance and improve service quality.

## Objectives
The dashboard helps answer questions like:
- How many patients visited the ER?
- What is the average waiting time?
- Are patients satisfied with the service?
- Which departments receive the most referrals?
- Which age groups visit the ER more frequently?

---

## Features of the Dashboard
The dashboard includes:

- Monthly filter (slicer based interaction)
- Key KPIs (No. of Patients, Avg Wait Time, Patient Satisfaction Score)
- Admission vs Non-Admission analysis
- Age group distribution of patients
- Department referral analysis
- Gender distribution
- Patients attended on time vs delayed

The dashboard is fully interactive and updates based on selected month.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query (data cleaning and shaping)
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Slicers (for interactivity)
- Conditional formatting
- Data visualization and KPI design

## Data Preparation
Before building the dashboard, the dataset required preparation.  
The following steps were performed:

- Cleaned inconsistent values
- Removed blank records
- Standardized column names
- Created calculated fields
- Structured the data for reporting

This step was important to ensure accurate reporting.

---

## Insights Generated
From the dashboard we can easily identify:

- Peak patient visiting periods
- Departments with highest load
- Average waiting time trends
- Patient satisfaction performance
- Demographic distribution of patients

These insights can help hospital management in improving staffing decisions and service efficiency.

## Key Learning
This project helped me understand:
- How Excel can be used as a reporting and BI tool
- Importance of clean data before visualization
- Designing dashboards for business users
- Converting raw data into actionable insights

---

## Future Improvements
- Automate data refresh
- Connect with a live database
- Rebuild dashboard in Power BI
